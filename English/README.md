## Project description
<p> The main objective of the project is to develop the basic concepts of complex network theory.There is also the presentation of fundamental tools for the representation, modeling, characterization and classification of complex networks. The concepts are applied in the analysis of the Internet, the World Wide Web, language, society, food chains, cellular interactions and road networks.</p>

<p>For more information, just search for the .PDF file in the folder of each project and below we have the following points studied:</p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Measures for topological characterization of complex networks: degree, agglomeration coefficient, number of cycles, length of the shortest paths, motives, centrality measures, spectral measures, hierarchical measures, fractal measures, community structure.</li>
  <li>Complex Network Generation Models and Algorithms: random graphs, small world model, free-scale networks, networks with hierarchical structure, configuration model</li>
  <li>Weighted networks</li>
  <li>Space networks</li>
  <li>Community detection methods</li>
  <li>Dynamic processes in complex networks: random walks, failures and attacks, cascading failures, communication and congestion, spread of epidemics, spread of opinions, synchronization and collective dynamics</li>
  <li>Optimization in complex networks: optimization of network flow and robustness</li>
  <li>Network search and navigation</li>
  <li>Generating Function</li>
  <li>Algorithms: page-rank, degree of intermediation, detection of communities, synchronization, cascading failures, random walks </li>
  <li>Applications: social networks, Internet, world Wide Web, Bioinformatics, brain, road networks, language, image processing, pattern recognition</li>
  <li>Classification of complex networks</li>
</ul>

### Prerequisites
To compile the programs it is only necessary to have access to a Jupyter Notebook, or Google Colab, and run the cells to obtain the results. The data for most resolutions is found in the Data folder for each project. For more agile processing, a tip would be to use GPUS instead of the CPU.

### Running the Application üé≤

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/brunereduardo/Complex_Networks_USP

# Access the project folder on terminal/cmd
$ cd Complex_Networks_USP/Project One

# Execute o seguinte comando para abrir o notebook
$ jupyter notebook Project1.ipynb

```

- sklearn
- Pandas
- Random
- Warnings
- OS
- Pyplot
- Seaborn
